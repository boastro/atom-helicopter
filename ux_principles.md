# Helicopter UX Principles

1. No need for extra mode, but having mode is possible
2. Methods on left side, arguments on the right side
3. The more common actions should be easier to access, so they should lie on the home row
4. Command modifier is mostly used for OS keybindings, so when it is used it should be also accessed via regular keybindings (<kbd>ctrl-f</kbd> will be used for replication)
5. Each key can has a variation. For example closing all tabs could close all tabs, but also could work as *close other tabs*. Default modifiers for variation choosing go like this: `ctrl`, without modifier,  `alt`, `cmd`
6. The system should be adaptable to any platform, as much as possible. So more funky features of keyboard should be only used as an addition to the system: entering mode, key chords, dual-role keys.
7. The rising goes from left to right, so the keys which are semantically smaller go to the left, and the bigger go to the right. So <kbd>*THIS*</kbd> is on the left, and <kbd>*All*</kbd> is on the right.
8. If it's about vectors it should follow the rotation of clockwise with the center between <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> keys. So <kbd>*↑*</kbd> and <kbd>*⤴*</kbd> are on the left side and <kbd>*↓*</kbd> and <kbd>*⤵*</kbd> are on the right.
